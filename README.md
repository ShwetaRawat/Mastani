#Fundraiser for Mastani 🐱
About Mastani
Mastani, our adorable feline friend, was found outside our hostel. As caring students, we’ve been looking after Mastani and ensuring regular vet visits. However, managing expenses can be challenging, especially for a student-led initiative. Currently, we urgently need funds for Mastani’s neutering surgery.
